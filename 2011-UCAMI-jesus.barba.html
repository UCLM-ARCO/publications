    Enabling Ambient Intelligence systems to understand the activities that are taking place in their surroundings is a rather complicated task that cannot be successfully addressed if the mechanisms that entitle humans to succeed in this task are ignored or overlooked. In this sense, it is the common-sense knowledge and reasoning capability which characterizes hu- man rationality and cognition. This work is therefore motivated by the conviction that only by encompassing common-sense into the Ambient Intelligence systems could they be entitled to understand the context and to react to it. However, there are some difficulties that need to be resolved before common- sense capabilities can be fully deployed to Ambient Intelligence. Among those issues, response time and efficiency features are two aspects that yet need to be improved. In this endeavor, this work presents a hardware accelerated implementation of a common-sense knowledge-base system.
