    <div><b>Abstract</b></div>
    The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm poses a great variety of application domains where million of devices work uninterruptedly to improve some aspect of our lives. To support the continuous execution of the applications working on the devices, energy harvesting systems enable to extract the energy found naturally in the environment (for instance from the sun or from the wind) and convert it into energy able to either sustain the device’s operation and recharge its batteries which, in conjunction with an appropriate scheduling strategy, led to the device to an electrically sustainable state (i.e. an energy-neutral state). Most of the works found in literature oriented to achieve energy neutrality are however evaluated by means of simulation which means that, in spite of precisely modeling hardware features and energy productions, lack of the realism that we find in a real deployment. A minor part of the works are based on a real deployment but do not share the collected data that permit to replicate the analysis. With this purpose in mind, in this article we describe a testbed designed for outdoor monitoring purposes in the IoT context, equipped 	       with several sensors for weather conditions monitoring and with a solar panel to provide application lifetimes potentially infinite. The testbed was deployed on the roof of a building and it executed uninterruptedly an application able to generate a dataset with the collected information over a period of more than two months. This dataset has been online published to be used for different researching purposes, as for instance, prediction models of the energy production.
