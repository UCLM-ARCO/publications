    Enviromental Intelligence has to do with developing services and applications which support the usual tasks of anyone at home, at the office or at any leisure place. The services offered in intelligent environments have to be personal, adaptive and transparent for users, the same as the installation of the infrastructure which supports these services. The complexity of the installation of a usual infrastructure in these environments is still an open issue because of the large diversity of technologies, applications and protocols. The main contribution of this paper is to bring up intelligent environments as Place & Play environments where devices are inmediately integrated without previos configuration. In particular, we center our work in the area of multimedia services: we will use as a demostrator a video transmission system based on Mobile Ad-hoc wireless Networks (MANETs) for which we hace developed the communication infrastructure and the service discovery protocol.
