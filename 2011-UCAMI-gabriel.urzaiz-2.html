    A solid and versatile communication platform is very important in modern Ambient Intelligence (AmI) applica- tions, which usually require the transmission of large amounts of multimedia information in a highly heterogeneous network connecting a very wide variety of terminal equipment. In such scenarios, processing time, versatility and efficiency are very important elements that must be taken into account. However, most AmI solutions are focused on other factors and rarely consider the communication itself. Most often it uses the first solution found, no matter that there are some new alternatives that may provide greater benefits. In a traditional computing scheme, the functions of processor, memory and network are clearly identified. The processing is done on the processors, the memory is used for storage, and the network performs communication. Our proposal is based on a slightly different idea, which is the ability for the network to perform processing, in addition to its traditional role of communication. The proposal focuses on the concept of Process-in-Network (PIN) defined as the possibility that the network processes information as it is being transmitted, and introduced as a more comprehensive approach than existing network processing technologies so far. PIN can take advantage of waiting times in queues of routers, idle processing capacity in intermediate nodes, and the information that passes thru the network. The main benefits may consist of a significant reduction in link utilization because the information is simplified and therefore reduces the need for network transmission, an enrichment of information as a result of an information fusion process as it passes through the network, and requiring less time and process in the terminal nodes under which the information reaches its destination with a pre-processing level achieved while it passes through the network. In this paper, the PIN concept is introduced, a high-level model is presented, and first experimental results are also included. We used the OMNeT++ network simulator in order to get preliminary numbers about the opportunity for PIN, and afterwards we developed few lines of code to demonstrate PIN feasibility.
