    In the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of natural disasters and terrorist attacks that were massive in scale and civilian casualties. In most of these disaster situations, rescue operations have been carried out on large scale. This paper assumes a heterogeneous network disaster recovery scenario and proposes a cost effective and easy to deploy hybrid communication system to achieve rescuersâ€™ requirements and cooperation. Designing a new protocol for hybrid network with different access protocols and with mobility and failures poses several challenges. The proposed protocol uses the Inter-Domain Messaging (IDM) framework to achieve the goal. The simulation shows the functionality of the hybrid protocol model (non-IP routing protocol), and maintains routes without the lower layer detection of link breaks.
