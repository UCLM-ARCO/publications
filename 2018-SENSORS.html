    A technology drift is currently taking place from traditional battery-powered sensor networks, which exhibit limited lifetime, to the new Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSN), which open the way towards self-sustained operation. However, this emergent modality also brings up new challenges, especially due to the time-varying nature and unpredictability of ambient energy sources. Most proposals for implementing EH-WSN rely on heuristic approaches to redesign the duty-cycling mechanism at the MAC layer, with the ultimate goal of optimizing network performance while preserving self-sustained and continuous operation. In contrast to the common system-wide reduced duty cycle of battery-powered sensor networks, the duty cycle in EH-WSN is much larger and adapted to the energy harvesting rate and traffic load of each node in the network. In this paper, we focus on solar-based EH-WSN devoted to environmental monitoring. In contrast to current works, we follow an analytical approach, which results into closed-form expressions for the duty cycle and initial energy storage that guarantee self-sustained operation to any node in a solar-based EH-WSN. To center the analysis, we consider TinyOS sensor nodes, though we postulate that the essential components of the obtained formulation will contribute to further develop duty cycle adaptation schemes for TinyOS and other software platforms.
