    This paper proposes the use of the STM32-F411RE development board (based on ARM Cortex-M4 processor) as the platform for the Microcontroller Based System Design course by applying the project-based learning pedagogy. The course syllabus contains the main functional blocks of a microcontroller that are reinforced by solving small challenges, hence, theoretical concepts and hands-on activities are linked. The STM32-F411RE devices include a debugging chip which is one of the main assets to debug programs as well as to analyze and explore them. This work concludes that this student-centered methodology motivates and prevents the abandonment of learners.
