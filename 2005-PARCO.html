    This work explores the capabilities of a new design methodology aimed at affering an integrated and homogeneous way of thinking on the whole system. This methodology allows extending a widespread communication model, the remote method invocation model, to the design of a NoC system as a part of a more complex distributed system. Some standardization efforts, such as OCP, have tried to define a common syntax for communications among NoC components but there is not a provision for a common semantics yet. On the other hand, there is a dramatic variation of the communication capabilities between two cores depending in the relative location of the two peers (on- and off- chip). Since a common communications infrastructure is missing, on-chip functionality may only be accessed from off-chip components using ad-hoc interfaces thar exists only if it has been foreseen by the designer. In this work we will discuss the way our proposed methodology is able to tackle these and many other issues without major overhead.
