    <div><b>Abstract</b></div>
    Heterogeneous system architectures are currently the main platform on which an ever increasing number of innovative applications (i.e. smart home or ambient intelligence applications) rely. When designing these complex systems, one of the most time-consuming tasks is the definition of the communication interfaces between the different components through a number of scattered heterogeneous processing nodes. That is not only a complex task, but also very specific for a particular implementation, which may limit the flexibility of the system, and makes the solutions difficult to reuse. In this paper, we describe how to provide a unified abstraction for both hardware and software components that have to cooperate with each other, independently of their implementation and their location. Based on this abstraction, we define a low-overhead system-wide communication architecture that offers total communication transparency between any kind of components. Since the architecture is highly compatible with standard object-oriented distributed software systems, it also enables seamless interaction with any other kind of external network.
