    With the growing amount of multimedial content over the internet and broadcast systems, mechanisms for efficient information organization, manipulation and transmission are becoming indispensable. Optimization of the multimedia search and retrieval processes is nowadays an important area of development due to the difficulty to browse, filter and manage that big amount of data. The adoption of the MPEG-7 standard has a significant importance to simplify the image retrieval process. However, performance issues are still relevant when the retrieval must be accomplished in real time. This work presents an innovative and efficient approach of a Content-Based Retrieval Process using metric spaces implemented in heterogeneous resources according to the demand of computational power. Several implementations were made and comparative results are shown evidencing the benefits of the proposed approach.
