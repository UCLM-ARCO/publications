    Over  the  past  decade,  High-Level  Synthesis  (HLS) tools  and methods  have  increasingly  become  mainstream  in  the strategy  of leading  companies  in  the field of  FPGAs. On  the  one hand,  HLS allows FPGA manufactures to widen the target market, smoothing the  existing  barriers  that prevented potential  users  from  adopting reconfigurable  hardware  technologies.  On  the  other hand,  HLS easies the work of system developers who benefit from integrated and automated design workflows, considerably reducing the “time to market” constrain. However,  there  is  still  some  uncertainty  about  the quality  and performance  of  the  designs  that  results  from  the  HLS  processes. As the HLS tools  increase the level of  abstraction,  it  is  necessary to  evaluate  if  the  incurred  performance  losses  compensate  the design  time  reduction.  Therefore,  a  better  understanding  of  HLS tradeoffs is needed to make the most of this technology. In   this   paper,   an   optimization   of   the   high-level   synthesis methodology using  Vivado HLS is presented. Several options  are analyzed    for    each   alternative   through   the   testing   of    the interpolators  used  in  the  Scalable Video Codec (SVC),  using  the Programmable Logic (PL) of the ZynQ device. Thus,  an accurate evaluation on the pros and cons of this implementation is provided to allow the designers  making decisions to speed-up their  circuits when using this methodology.
